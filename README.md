# tinytg

A tiny set of tools to communicate with Telegram Mini Apps API.

Add to your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/player21o/tinytg.git
```

# why?

This repo is intended for those who want a small (a few kilobytes) and unabstracted way to use Mini Apps API. Everything is stripped down to bare functions without any components or signals.
